# COVID-19-DATA-EXPLORATION

For almost 2 years, we have been living with the Covid-19 Pandemic since it surfaced in November 2019. By exploring and analysing the dataset, I hope to understand current trend based on data

I have extract the Covid-19 Dataset from OurWorldinData from 24 Feb 2020 to 22 June 2021.

This project is designed to highlight my following SQL skills:

* Order of Query Execution
* Manipulating Datasets with NULLs
* Multi-Table Queries with JOINs
* Queries with Mathematical Expressions
* Convert Data Types
* Aggregate Functions
* Window Functions
* Common Table Expressions
* Create Temporary Tables
* Create Views

## Analysis Process
* Initial analysis of datasets used Microsoft Excel.
* Data cleaning, manipulation and exploration using Microsoft SQL.
* Data Visualization using Tableau Public via Dashboard.

From the dataset, 4 key areas interests me for me to perform further analysis:

* % Population Infected Per Country
* Global Covid Numbers
* Total Death Per Continents
* % Population Infected of 5 countries that I am interested in.
